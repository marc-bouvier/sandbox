== Plain text

[.small]
[quote,"Andrew Hunt, David Thomas","The Pragmatic Programmer: from journeyman to master"]
As Pragmatic Programmers, our base material isn't wood or iron, it's knowledge. We gather requirements as knowledge, and then express that knowledge in our designs, implementations, tests, and documents. And we believe that the best format for storing knowledge persistently is plain text. With plain text, we giec ourselves the ability to manipulate knowledge, both manually and programmatically, using virtually every tool at our disposal.

=== Why Plain Text

* Standard version control
* greppable
* automation
* Souveraineté numérique
** Own your data AND your tooling (you can use open source)
** Not bound to MS Office
* But, not everyone is technical and cannot write code & push to git
** Headless CMS

=== Markdown

* primitive lightweight syntax
* embed HTML
* Github
* Repo
* Pages
* Azure DevOps
* Wiki as code

=== Markdown pros/cons

Pros

* primitive syntax
* supported everywhere

Cons

* Flavour hell
* not much advanced features
* embed HTML if

=== Asciidoc

* [Asciidoc](https://asciidoc-py.github.io/)
* [Asciidoctor](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/)
* Github
* Repo
* Pages
* https://antora.org/
** Multi repository doc site generator

=== Asciidoc pros/cons

Pros

* Converters
* Built-in
* Html
* XHTML
* DocBook
* Man page
* Add-on
* PDF
* EPUB3
* Reveal.js
* Bespoke
* Supported in most serious IDEs
* Actionable from code
* Asciidoclet
* Maven tools
* much more capabilities out of the box (see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/asciidoc-vs-markdown/[Compare AsciiDoc to Markdown])
* includes
* split your .adoc files
* include code snippets from your real code
* Links
* Admonitions
* Better tables (IMHO)
* Better quotes
* anchors
* collapsible blocks
* extension system
* multiple implementations
* Asciidoctor (Ruby)
* AsciidoctorJs (Js) (transpiled from Ruby)
* AsciidoctorJ (Java)
* migration from markdown
* [some of markdown syntax is compatible](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/#markdown-compatibility)
* migrate form/to ms word with pandoc (https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/migrate/ms-word/)
Cons

* much more syntax to learn (but you don't need to learn everything for simple document)
* not supported everywhere yet
* Azure DevOps
* At the moment, there is no rich text editor for Asciidoc supported, which limits non-technical writing with headless CMS
