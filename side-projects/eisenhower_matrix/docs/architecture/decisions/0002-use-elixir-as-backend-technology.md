# 2. Use Elixir as backend technology

Date: 2018-09-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Learning Elixir in order to master it for future projects.

## Decision

Elixir will be the langage used in backend of the web application. 

## Consequences

Elixir will allow better concurrent processing and functional programming will make data transformations
easier to grasp. It has lightweight thread that allows to scale. Also provides Fault-tolerance
way more accessible than in others languages. Elixir is extensible and allows to write macros
to create homebrew DSLs. 

Elixir is still a young language. Major and breaking changes may occur. Even if it is not
planned that way in the language's roadmap.

You will be forced to design for concurrency.
With time you will have to learn Erlang which is hard and not very developer friendly.
