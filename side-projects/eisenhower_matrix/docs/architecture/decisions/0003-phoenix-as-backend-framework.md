# 3. Phoenix as backend framework

Date: 2018-09-17

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Elixir is the stack choosen for backen. Phoenix can manage web transformations happening in the backed ontop of elixir.

## Decision

Phoenix Framework will be used as backend technology to manage inputs and outputs from the user.

## Consequences

Using conventions proposed by Phoenix will make the application more concise and and understandable
from developpers knowing the framework. Having some similarities with Ruby of Rails may also
make it more approachable by these folks.

Like Elixir, it is still a young framework and it can evolve with breaking changes. The application
is not likely to be very big, so a migration can be a learning opportunity more than inconvenience.
