# Place where I want to work

- Organization and domain matches ethically with me. Must have sense to me
- Does code review
- Does TDD
- Does regular scheduled feedback to learn (retrospective...)
- Open to innovation
- Learning organization (presentations, formation, tech dailies...)
- Agile? (XP)
- Disciplined : TDD, pair-programming, code review, clean code, visual management
- Focused : one project at a time
- Ubiquitous language : I expect to meet and exchange with domain experts often.
