= Powerful questions

Powerful questions dig into underlying assumptions, they create interest, and most of all they get people interested and good discussions come forth from them.

== Examples

- What is the smallest possible thing we can do to deliver this business value?
- What is the need this system fills, not “what it does”
- If I turned off the server tomorrow who would be the first person to notice and why?
- How would you verify that this is working correctly?
- what is the earliest point you can know whether the system has any value to you? How will we do this?
- Why are we starting here?
