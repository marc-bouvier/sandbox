= Piepline as code

Pipeline-as-Code : treating the continuous delivery pipeline a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like any other code. 

.jenkinsfile

Creating a Jenkinsfile, which is checked into source control [1], provides a number of immediate benefits:

- Code review/iteration on the Pipeline
- Audit trail for the Pipeline
- Single source of truth [2] for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple members of the project.
